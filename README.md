# CSE 163 Project:
## 1) Datasets:
This project uses the files labeled csv_hwa.zip and csv_pwa.zip downloaded
from the link https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2018/1-Year/
as the main datasets. When unzipped, they should be named psam_h53.csv
and psam_p53.csv, respectively.
It also uses two notebook files which should have been submitted with the
project, containing information from the 2018 1-year ACS data dictionary found
at https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/pums/data_dict/PUMS_Data_Dictionary_2018.pdf .
Because it's a pdf file, I ended up transcribing the small slice of labels I wanted into csv text
files by hand-- they should be labelled shortened_fam_labels.txt and
language_recode.txt .

## 2) Modules:
The python modules needed for this project are pandas, numpy, seaborn,
matplotlib, and scipy (for its stats library). In the project itself, there
should be three modules: data_cleanup.py, data_visualizations.py, and
language_family.py.

**Run the project by running data_visualizations.py.**
